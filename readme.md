# Purple Crow Developer Screening

## One Hundred Prisoners Problem

Your goal is to program a simulation of the `One Hundred Prisoners` problem using the optimal strategy.
You do not have to design the optimal strategy yourself.
That work is already done for you.
Watch the first 4 minutes of this video for a clear 
explanation of the problem and the optimal strategy: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA

The remainder of the video details how the solution works,
but is not necessary viewing to be able to program the simulation.

The problem and optimal solution is also outlined clearly on Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem

Once you understand the problem and the optimal solution, 
edit [OneHundredPrisoners.cs](OneHundredPrisoners.cs) by implementing the `RunSimulation()` method.
Your code should return true if all 100 prisoners found their own number within 50 attempts.

Once the simulation is correctly programmed, 
the test defined in [OneHundredPrisonersTests.cs](OneHundredPrisonersTests.cs) will pass.
The unit test runs your code many thousands of times and is expecting a result of `true` about 31% of the time.

## Cheating
Do not use a solution that you find on the internet.
Cheaters will be eliminated in later stages of our interview process and besides, it's just not cool to cheat.
We are looking for developers that can skillfully interpret requirements and implement solutions.

## Questions
Feel free to ask clarifying questions!
Email `ronnie.overby@purplecrow.com` and I will respond as quickly as possible.

## Submitting Your Work
Once satisfied with your work, zip the solution and **email** it to `ronnie.overby@purplecrow.com`.

Thank you for your interest!
